The dataset is available at (../data/htwt.csv) and is imported to sas using proc import procedure.\n\nDescriptive Statistics\nThe first step is to obtain the simple descriptive statistics for the numeric variables of htwt data, and one-way frequencies for categorical variables. This is accomplished by employing proc means and proc freq procedures There are 237 participants who are from 13.9 to 25 years old. It is a cross-sectional study, with each participant having one observation. We can use this data set to examine the relationship of participants’ height to their age and sex.\n\nproc means data=htwt;\nrun;\n\n                    Descriptive Statistics for HTWT Data Set                  \n                             The MEANS Procedure\n\nVariable  Label     N          Mean       Std Dev       Minimum       Maximum\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAGE       AGE     237    16.4430380     1.8425767    13.9000000    25.0000000\nHEIGHT    HEIGHT  237    61.3645570     3.9454019    50.5000000    72.0000000\nWEIGHT    WEIGHT  237   101.3080169    19.4406980    50.5000000   171.5000000\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nproc freq data=htwt;\ntables sex;\nrun;\n\n    Oneway Frequency Tabulation for Sex for HTWT Data Set                    \n                    The FREQ Procedure\n\n                                      Cumulative    Cumulative\nSEX         Frequency     Percent     Frequency      Percent\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nf           111           46.84           111        46.84\nm           126           53.16           237       100.00\n\nIn order to create a regression model to demonstrate the relationship between age and height for females, we first need to create a flag variable identifying females and an interaction variable between age and female gender flag.\n\ndata htwt2;\n  set htwt;\n  if sex=\"f\" then female=1;\n  if sex=\"m\" then female=0; \n \n  *model to demonstrate interaction between female gender and age;\n  fem_age = female * age;  \nrun;\n\n\n\nRegression Analysis\nNext, we fit a regression model, representing the relationships between gender, age, height and the interaction variable created in the datastep above. We again use a where statement to restrict the analysis to those who are less than or equal to 19 years old. We use the clb option to get a 95% confidence interval for each of the parameters in the model. The model that we are fitting is height = b0 + b1 x female + b2 x age + b3 x fem_age + e\n\nproc reg data=htwt2;\n  where age &lt;=19;\n  model height = female age fem_age / clb;\nrun; quit;\n\n                        Number of Observations Read         219\n                        Number of Observations Used         219\n\n                                 Analysis of Variance\n\n                                        Sum of           Mean\n    Source                   DF        Squares         Square    F Value    Pr &gt; F\n    Model                     3     1432.63813      477.54604      60.93    &lt;.0001\n    Error                   215     1684.95730        7.83701\n    Corrected Total         218     3117.59543\n\n                 Root MSE              2.79947    R-Square     0.4595\n                 Dependent Mean       61.00457    Adj R-Sq     0.4520\n                 Coeff Var             4.58895\n\nWe examine the parameter estimates in the output below.\n\n                            Parameter Estimates\n                            Parameter       Standard\n       Variable     DF       Estimate          Error    t Value    Pr &gt; |t|       95% Confidence Limits\n       Intercept     1       28.88281        2.87343      10.05      &lt;.0001       23.21911       34.54650\n       female        1       13.61231        4.01916       3.39      0.0008        5.69031       21.53432\n       AGE           1        2.03130        0.17764      11.44      &lt;.0001        1.68117        2.38144\n       fem_age       1       -0.92943        0.24782      -3.75      0.0002       -1.41791       -0.44096\n\nFrom the parameter estimates table the coefficients b0,b1,b2,b3 are estimated as b0=28.88 b1=13.61 b2=2.03 b3=-0.92942\nThe resulting regression model for height, age and gender based on the available data is height=28.88281 + 13.61231 x female + 2.03130 x age -0.92943 x fem_age"

Jayashree presented on behalf of CAMIS but on a Shiny App & got good questions including highlighting that for Endpoint /efficacy analysis they may require very specific standards so not easy to be generic/default. Chris Hurley (PHUSE SDE) also mentioned CAMIS which is great exposure for us.\nPreparation for PHUSE FDA Quarterly meeting 27th sept:  Questions/Slides feedback: Lyn/ Harshal\nMeeting was postponed by 4 weeks so we have time to prepare a short survey and send out on social media. Harshal went through the proposed questionnaire. Filip suggested Q2 to refer to frequency more specifically. Harshal to update & distribute\nSocial Media update : Harshal\nHarshal has posted the PSI poster post to social media. Going forward the proposal is to run a series of posts to focus on the content on the website - perhaps a short post just to say have you seen this new content and provide links.\nRE: Workshop - FDA CSS event (5-7 June): could run a comparison of SAS vs R workshop. Could focus on a set of issues & work though them make content & resolve issues. Could turn to linkedIn to ask wider community to vote for the biggest issue outstanding that they’d like to look into and select these for resolving at the workshop. See item below, as can discuss with Soma following this years FDA CSS event.\nWebsite Christina/ All\n\nThank you ALL!! Much content has been recenly pushed to the website.\nNew Role needed for a “Content curation lead”\n\nWe have been missing some posts when added to issues/discussion pages on website\nThis role will Monitor the  “Discussion” and “Issues” pages of the repo, and help to raise at each meeting where we need volunteers to answer questions/ add to discussion.\nWe will add a Standard agenda item lead by the “Content curation lead” to go through issues, & assign to people / close down issues/ discussions.\nJayashree & Chi volunteered to take on the role & to help monitor the repo activity. Lyn & Christina can put together guidance of what’s needed. Currently it’s just the issues & discussion, as pull requests are currently Ok being approved by Lyn & Christina as it’s a bit tricky to make sure it fits in with the repo and doens’t break anything!\nChi suggested that Christina check out projects to see if that would help to monitor whose doing what - may not work if can only be accessed by those already with granted access as we want anyone to be able to assign themselves. ACTION Christina to: Change the readme to say how to assign yourselves to content tasks.\n\nHow can we encourage creation of more content? / What areas are key for us to focus on\n\nGreat increase in content pre-meeting so Ok to grow organically for now.\nMMRM update : Christina to add link to MMRM website to cross reference.\n\ngithub training plan (R/Pharma workshop - free to attend in end October & PSI training course - series of session each week for x weeks, & PSI Conference Amsterdam - workshop 1.5 hrs.)\n\nPHUSE FDA CSS Poster acceptance (sept 20th) & white paper planning/ CAMIS ONCO: Soma Sekhar\nSoma demonstrated the poster which he’ll present with Vikash at CSS. Focused on Solid tumors OS/PFS but could broaden CAMIS ONCO with time to include other cancer.\nLonger term plan to create a white paper and to load survival analysis in python to repo.\nSoma to work with Harshil & others, to plan a sub team to work on CSS workshop for June 2023.\nLyn asked if there is demand for packages to be written that do standard stats analysis? The difficulty with this is how to standardise the programming and what it adds in addition to existing packages. It may not be worthwhile as options need to be considered so can’t automate.\nUpcoming conference planning.\n\nRSS 7th Sept: Lyn presentation\n\n\n\nPOSIT Conf: Lyn to reach out to Juliane / Doug to ask to include slide for CAMIS\nPHUSE SDE New York: Oct 16th :  Aiming\nR/Pharma - Christina submitted presentation\n\nAOQ/AOB - None."

    "text": "Christina provided a summary of work to date on the website\nRepo now live: [https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/]\nPrimary mode of navigation will be the table of contents..\nComprehensive Search function is available to supplement the use of the TOC.\nThe website is build from 3 folders in github:\nR SAS Comp\nThese folders, map to the columns of the table, I.e. everything about R is in Quarto files under R.\nComp folder: for the Comparison – name sure you name the two software you are using r-sas - so we can use this when dynamically selecting.\nIn future we can add Python / Julia directories.\nThe idea would be for people to use the: [CAMIS/templates/R_template.qmd] - A template of how to write documentation for the R part of the site. They’d Edit template & save it back into the R folder naming it clearly for what it is. Template should also contain name packages being used at start of each method comparison. It’d be difficult to be exhaustive with all the survival analysis packages i.e. accelerated failure time packages, etc.., but as long as stated hopefully can grow over time.\nThe Data-info folder – contains description of all data being used for the comparisons. Going forward if different data used, the information about the data would be put into this folder. This allows the data description to sit outside of the comparison folders & where possible same data be used across comparisons.\n\nQuestions & Discussion\nJoe & Michael raised that the About tab which has information about the project is out of date, so should be updated. We also have no detail on the driving mechanism… I.e. what we would like from collaborators. Add “How to collaborate” button.\nItems to be discussed further which may need to be included in the site:\n\nupdate Methods: needs to make it more robust to future uploads - i.e. topics within linear models? (Sub categories) focus on methods, but how sort the methods for inclusion of all in future\nRating the software discrepancies. I..e How severe the difference is?\nNeed to create a template for comparisons. Discuss if we would have a purpose/highlight of comparison/ summary/conclusions at the top first. Also if we put List of R packages this comparison uses (use Tags?) - Need to consider if package superseeded/ multiple packages whether they go in 1 document or multiple.\nHow to expand to sort by: therapeutic area relevance (would be good to link from methods to Oncology somehow\nWhat if a different package.., does same analysis… have to make it clear which package is being used & include multiple packages. It was agreed that as long as we are clear on what we have compared then Its ok to not be all inclusive. That can be added by other collaborators later. It was noted by Kyle that for survival (I.e. accelerated failure time packages), it may be hard to include all. The recommendation is to start with 1 and can expand further as it grows. We may have to re-think website design as it grows to accommodate. Hence why we want everything written in smaller parts to can easily manipulate going forward."

The emmeans function permits various marginal means to be extracted depending on the formula provided and the following pairs() function call derives relevant contrasts. Note that more control can be obtained by calling the contrast() function.\n\nmod_grid &lt;- ref_grid(model, data = data, mode = \"df.error\")\nmod_emm &lt;- emmeans(mod_grid, ~TRTP * AVISITN, mode = \"df.error\") \npairs(mod_emm)"

A primary difference in these implementations lies in the covariance structures that are supported “out of the box”. In particular, PROC GLIMMIX and mmrm are the only procedures which provide support for many of the most common MMRM covariance structures. Most covariance structures can be implemented in gls, though users are required to define them manually. lmer and glmmTMB are more limited. We find that mmmrm converges more quickly than other R implementations while also producing estimates that are virtually identical to PROC GLIMMIX’s."

We investigate this further by simulating data using a data-generating process similar to that of the BCVA datasets, though with various rates of patient dropout.\nTen datasets of 200 patients are generated each of the following levels of missingness: none, mild, moderate, and high. In all scenarios, observations are missing at random. The number patients observed at each visit is obtained for one replicated dataset at each level of missingness is presented in the table below.\n\n\n\nNumber of patients per visit\n\n\n\nnone\nmild\nmoderate\nhigh\n\n\n\n\nVIS01\n200\n196.7\n197.6\n188.1\n\n\nVIS02\n200\n195.4\n194.4\n182.4\n\n\nVIS03\n200\n195.1\n190.7\n175.2\n\n\nVIS04\n200\n194.1\n188.4\n162.8\n\n\nVIS05\n200\n191.6\n182.5\n142.7\n\n\nVIS06\n200\n188.2\n177.3\n125.4\n\n\nVIS07\n200\n184.6\n168.0\n105.9\n\n\nVIS08\n200\n178.5\n155.4\n82.6\n\n\nVIS09\n200\n175.3\n139.9\n58.1\n\n\nVIS10\n200\n164.1\n124.0\n39.5\n\n\n\n\n\nThe convergence rates of all implementations for stratified by missingness level is presented in the plot below.\n\n\n\n\n\nmmrm, gls, and PROC GLIMMIX are resilient to missingness, only exhibiting some convergence problems in the scenarios with the most missingness. These implementations converged in all the other scenarios’ replicates. glmmTMB, on the other hand, has convergence issues in the no-, mild-, and high-missingness datasets, with the worst convergence rate occurring in the datasets with the most dropout. Finally, lmer is unreliable in all scenarios, suggesting that it’s convergence issues stem from something other than the missing observations.\nNote that the default optimization schemes are used for each method; these schemes can be modified to potentially improve convergence rates.\nA more comprehensive simulation study using data-generating processes similar to the one used here is outlined in the simulations/missing-data-benchmarks subdirectory. In addition to assessing the effect of missing data on software convergence rates, we also evaluate these methods’ fit times and empirical bias, variance, 95% coverage rates, type I error rates and type II error rates. mmrm is found to be the most most robust software for fitting MMRMs in scenarios where a large proportion of patients are missing from the last time points. Additionally, mmrm has the fastest average fit times regardless of the amount of missingness. All implementations considered produce similar empirical biases, variances, 95% coverage rates, type I error rates and type II error rates."

The resultant p value informs the magnitude of disagreement with the null hypothesis and not the magnitude of association\nFor this example we will use data about cough symptoms and history of bronchitis.\n\nbronch &lt;- matrix(c(26, 247, 44, 1002), ncol = 2)\nrow.names(bronch) &lt;- c(\"cough\", \"no cough\")\ncolnames(bronch) &lt;- c(\"bronchitis\", \"no bronchitis\")\n\nTo a chi-squared test in R you will use the following code.\n\nchisq.test(bronch)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  bronch\nX-squared = 11.145, df = 1, p-value = 0.0008424\n\n\nTo run a chi-squared test in SAS you used the following code.\n\nproc freq data=proj1.bronchitis;\ntables Cough*Bronchitis / chisq;\nrun;\n\nThe result in the “Chi-Square” section of the results table in SAS will not match R, in this case it will be 12.1804 with a p-value of 0.0005. This is because by default R does a Yate’s continuity adjustment. To change this set correct to false.\n\nchisq.test(bronch, correct = FALSE)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  bronch\nX-squared = 12.18, df = 1, p-value = 0.0004829\n\n\nAlternatively, SAS also produces the correct chi-square value by default. It is the “Continuity Adj. Chi-Square” value in the results table."

In contrast, there is no option to include Edward’s continuity correction in SAS, but this can be manually coded to agree with R. However, its use is controversial due to being seen as overly conservative.\nR’s use of the continuity correction is consistent with other functions within the epibasix package, which was categorised as ‘High Risk’ by the Risk Assessment Shiny App created by the R Validation Hub. Risk is quantified by the app through a number of metrics relating to maintenance and community usage. It was found that the author is no longer maintaining the package and there was no documentation available for certain methods used. Therefore, the use of the epibasix package is advised against and other packages may be more suitable.\nThe mcnemar.test function in the stats package provides the option to remove continuity corrections which results in a match with SAS.

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nTraditionally, highly regulated industries (such as the pharmaceutical industry), have limited themselves to the use of commercially available software. When taking such an approach, the responsibility for the validation and testing of the product was often delegated to the software development company themselves, to ensure the software performs in line with its documentation, producing accurate reliable and reproducible results. However, one downside of this approach is that new methods and functionality can be slow to be adopted, limiting new method implementation and tools that can bring in efficiency.\nWith the increase in popularity of data science, the rate at which community led tools and methods are being developed in open-source software is rapid. The availability of advanced analytic capabilities, has led to increased desire for statistical staff in regulated industries to have access and approval to use to open source software (Rimler et al. 2022). The use of open source software is now widely accepted (FDA 2015), however, this increased variety of tools has resulted in an overlap of capabilities. This has raised challenging questions of traditional approaches to clinical analyses – particularly in situations where the overlap yields different results.\nOne example of this challenge encompasses discrepancies which have been discovered in statistical analysis results between different programming languages, even when working within qualified statistical computing environments. Subtle differences exist between the fundamental approaches and assumptions implemented within each language, yielding differences in results which are correct and consistent with their respective documentation. The fact that these differences exist may cause unease for sponsor companies when submitting to a regulatory agency, as it is uncertain if the agency will view these differences as problematic. By understanding the source of any discrepancies, one can reinstate that confidence.\nThis cross-industry group aims to empower statistical staff to make informed choices on the implementation of statistical analyses when multiple languages yield different results."

    "text": "Matching Contrasts: R and SAS\nIt is recommended to use the emmeans package when attempting to match contrasts between R and SAS. In SAS, all contrasts must be manually defined, whereas in R, we have many ways to use pre-existing contrast definitions. The emmeans package makes simplifies this process, and provides syntax that is similar to the syntax of SAS.\nThis is how we would define a contrast in SAS.\n\n# In SAS\nproc glm data=work.mycsv;\n   class drug;\n   model post = drug pre / solution;\n   estimate 'C vs A'  drug -1  1 0;\n   estimate 'E vs CA' drug -1 -1 2;\nrun;\n\nAnd this is how we would define the same contrast in R, using the emmeans package.\n\nlm(formula = post ~ pre + drug, data = df_trial) %&gt;% \n  emmeans(\"drug\") %&gt;% \n  contrast(method = list(\n    \"C vs A\"  = c(-1,  1, 0),\n    \"E vs CA\" = c(-1, -1, 2)\n  ))\n\nNote, however, that there are some cases where the scale of the parameter estimates between SAS and R is off, though the test statistics and p-values are identical. In these cases, we can adjust the SAS code to include a divisor. As far as we can tell, this difference only occurs when using the predefined Base R contrast methods like contr.helmert.\n\nproc glm data=work.mycsv;\n   class drug;\n   model post = drug pre / solution;\n   estimate 'C vs A'  drug -1  1 0 / divisor = 2;\n   estimate 'E vs CA' drug -1 -1 2 / divisor = 6;\nrun;"

    "text": "Rounding; R and SAS\nOn comparing the documentation of rounding rules for both languages, it will be noted that the default rounding rule (implemented in the respective language’s round() function) are different. Numerical differences arise in the knife-edge case where the number being rounded is equidistant between the two possible results. The round() function in SAS will round the number ‘away from zero’, meaning that 12.5 rounds to the integer 13. The round() function in Base R will round the number ‘to even’, meaning that 12.5 rounds to the integer 12. SAS does provide the rounde() function which rounds to even and the janitor package in R contains a function round_half_up() that rounds away from zero. In this use case, SAS produces a correct result from its round() function, based on its documentation, as does R. Both are right based on what they say they do, but they produce different results (Rimler, M.S. et al.).\nReferences\nRimler M.S., Rickert J., Jen M-H., Stackhouse M.

    "text": "Introduction\nSeveral discrepancies have been discovered in statistical analysis results between different programming languages, even in fully qualified statistical computing environments. Subtle differences exist between the fundamental approaches implemented by each language, yielding differences in results which are each correct in their own right. The fact that these differences exist causes unease on the behalf of sponsor companies when submitting to a regulatory agency, as it is uncertain if the agency will view these differences as problematic. In its Statistical Software Clarifying Statement, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that it “FDA does not require use of any specific software for statistical analyses” and that “the computer software used for data management and statistical analysis should be reliable.” Observing differences across languages can reduce the analyst’s confidence in reliability and, by understanding the source of any discrepancies, one can reinstate confidence in reliability.\n\nMotivation\nThe goal of this project is to demystify conflict when doing QC and to help ease the transitions to new languages and techniques with comparison and comprehensive explanations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Methods\n      R\n      SAS\n      Comparison\n    \n  \n  \n    Summary Statistics\nRounding\nR\nSAS\nR vs SAS\n    Summary statistics\nR\nSAS\nR vs SAS\n    General Linear Models\nStudents t-test\n\nSAS\n\n    Paired t-test\n\n\n\n    ANOVA\nR\nSAS\nR vs SAS\n    ANCOVA\nR\n\n\n    MANOVA\nR\nSAS\nR vs SAS\n    Linear Regression\nR\nSAS\n\n    Generalized Linear Models\nLogistic Regression\nR\n\n\n    Poisson/Negative Binomial Regression\n\n\n\n    Categorical Repeated Measures\n\n\n\n    Categorical Multiple Imputation\n\n\n\n    Non-parametric Analysis\nWilcoxon signed rank\n\n\n\n    Mann-Whitney U/Wilcoxon rank sum\nR\n\n\n    Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\n\n\n\n    Kruskall-Wallis test\nR\nSAS\nR vs SAS\n    Friedman test\n\n\n\n    Jonckheere test\n\n\n\n    Categorical Data Analysis\nBinomial test\n\n\n\n    McNemar's test\nR\nSAS\nR vs SAS\n    Chi-Square Association/Fishers exact\nR\n\nR vs SAS\n    Cochran Mantel Haenszel\nR\nSAS\nR vs SAS\n    Confidence Intervals for proportions\n\n\n\n    Linear Mixed Models\nMMRM\nR\nSAS\nR vs SAS\n    Generalized Linear Mixed Models\nMMRM\n\n\n\n    Multiple Imputation - Continuous Data MAR\nMCMC\n\n\n\n    Linear regression\n\n\n\n    Predictive Mean Matching\n\n\n\n    Propensity Scores\n\n\n\n    Multiple Imputation - Continuous Data MNAR\nDelta Adjustment/Tipping Point\n\n\n\n    Reference-Based Imputation/Sequential Methods\n\n\n\n    Reference-Based Imputation/Joint Modelling\n\n\n\n    Correlation\nPearson's/ Spearman's/ Kendall's Rank\nR\n\n\n    Survival Models\nKaplan-Meier Log-rank test and Cox-PH\nR\nSAS\nR vs SAS\n    Accelerated Failure Time\n\n\n\n    Non-proportional hazards methods\n\n\n\n    Sample size /Power calculations\nSingle timepoint analysis\n\n\n\n    Group-sequential designs\n\n\n\n    Multivariate methods\nClustering\n\n\n\n    Factor analysis\n\n\n\n    PCA\n\n\n\n    Canonical correlation\n\n\n\n    PLS\n\n\n\n    Other Methods\nNearest neighbour\n\n\n\n    Causal inference\n\n\n\n    Machine learning"

Harshal has been instrumental through 2023 helping Christina and I stay on track and making suggestions for improving the social media and knowledge sharing within the group.\nMMRM now updated & Complete for now.\nGithub training will be on youtube following R/pharma conference soon\n\n2023 : A Year of Progress for PHUSE CAMIS Working Group\nAs we draw towards the end of 2023, the PHUSE CAMIS Working Group reflect on their key progress and successes this year.\nThe CAMIS repository went live in January 2023, drawing on the content from the PHUSE CSRMLW project.  This searchable repo compares analysis method implementations in software (CAMIS) such as SAS, R and python. \nThe White Paper was published in June, which highlighted the importance of clearly specifying your analysis, such that it can be replicated in different software, and isn’t relying on default options which can be different.\nFor more complex analyses, it can still be hard to understand what defaults and algorithms your software is using, so the team focused 2023 on expanding our repo content, comparing SAS vs R methods.  By August, we had covered the following topics in the repo: quartiles, rounding, anova, mmrm, cmh, log-rank, cox-ph, mcnemar’s test, kruskal-wallis test and logistic. October saw the launch of the sub-working group: CAMIS-Oncology, led by Somasekhar Sriadibhatla (AstraZeneca).  This team will focus specifically on oncology endpoints and analyzing them in SAS, R and Python.  The CAMIS team have expanded in membership during 2023 presenting at numerous conferences around the world. In November, we welcomed Harshal Khanolkar (NovoNordisk), to join the leadership team alongside Christina Fillmore (GSK) and Lyn Taylor (PAREXEL).  Our focus for 2024, will be on the creation of additional content for the repo, and sharing awareness of the project across the medical research and wider community.  We’d like to take this opportunity to thank all of our team members and contributors, and encourage everyone to check out the repository and help us to grow our content CAMIS (psiaims.github.io).  If you would like to join the team please get in touch through the repo.\n2023: lessons learnt: What we did well?\n\nAdverts to industry & linkedin posts. To be Continued into 2024 - engage more unis, internship projects, academia, posit conf, r users conf, target key conferences\nGood sharing of conference content through the repo & improving the slides in an ongoing way.\nLeadership & project progress with plans. Transparency of the work. Nice to get Agendas pre-meeting & minutes after meeting in timely manner.\nLarge range of individual contributions helping to grow repo. 1/2 contributors within the phuse group, but 1/2 outside of the group. So spreading the word is really helping us to get external contributions.\nACTION: Christina & Chi: Please can you improve the 2023 conference tab, create a 2024 tab which contains link to presentations within the github repo.\n\n2023: lessons learnt: What we didn’t do so well?\n\nTime to get pull requests approved. Aim for 2024 to reduce the time so it’s a maximum of 2 weeks. The delay was often caused by issues with renv. Christina is working with posit directly to improve renv issues & has already updated contributions guidance to help instruct people on how to contribute such as using Forks rather than needing github username access.\npython - Delayed discussion in how to design the repo to store python content.\nACTION: Vikash/ Soma / Filip - to meet with Lyn / Christina to agree format going forward.\nMore discussion on CAMIS ONCO below.\n\n\n2023: lessons learnt: What is our focus for next year?\n\nMore content\nengage more unis, internship projects, academia, posit conf, r users conf, target key conferences\nCAMIS ONCO white paper, workshop & python/sas/r comparison (See below)\nCSS 2024 workshop, interaction with audience. 3-4 hrs hopefully. TBD at separate meeting, agenda workshop. Vikash, Harshal, Soma. 3-5 June.\nIdea for 2024: Set up a method such that people with no git / github skills can still contribute to the project. Perhaps set up a CAMIS email address. Assign volunteers for someone to email, then the github experts can load it in. Decide best process to non-R, non-github people.\n\nCAMIS-ONCO\nPlan to create cheat sheet for phuse 2024 - can go on CAMIS.\nNeed more volunteers in order to address all the endpoints. Oncology / survival team members needed to join Soma & Team. AZ investing in ChatGPT AZ version, it can create python code from SAS.\nIf AI can convert SAS code to python, we will then need people to test it. Volunteers needed to run in python. Can use the CAMIS repo data to test on hopefully but may need more detailed data? To see what data we currently have in the repo: see “data-info” and “data” folders.\nAction: Chi to have a look at the data folders, and decide better way to control/document data. Chi volunteered to help with Soma’s test to test Python. Harshal may also be able to find volunteers at novonordisk. Starting point for python would be the default options vs R.\n\nACTION: Lyn to Add to members list, who can run which languages & specialist areas (CAMIS-ONCO). ACTION: Soma to put poster into non_website_content/conferences.\nCAMIS: ONCO White paper: Needs to be progressed. invite all members to see if they can contribute. Set up regular meetings in 2024.\nPlan for 2024 : Project board in github: 5 categories\n\nCAMIS : Generic Method Implementation Team: More content\nCAMIS-ONCO: items as above\nUser Experience/Demo Team\nSocial media & Engagement: Advertise/ Universities\n\nbi-monthly post re: new content (newsletter: form to subscribe to newsletter so that when we post out they get informed). ACTION: lyn to check with PHUSE if we can do this, or if we want to ask R consortium to help similar to R validation hub email list.\nAlso would be good to have blog post tab on repository. ACTION: Chi to help Christina with design. Idea would be to have 1 post which goes out on social media, to the emails subscription & on the website.\nmore relationship with ASA OpenStatsware - Orla Doyle.\nopenstatsware (rconsortium.github.io) ACTION: Lyn/Christina/Orla to set up call to discuss collaboration.\n\n\nGeneral Tasks:\n\nPlan to review & accept content within 2 weeks of pull requests.\nPOSIT help with RENV situation\nSearch Engine Optimization: CAMIS full name on website? how do we become top hit ? Any volunteers to help with this let us know.\n\n\nACTION: Lyn to Cancel Dec Meeting 11th Dec. next meeting 8th Jan 2024"

Examples could include, if someone writes content on MRMM, you ask them to write a short description on what they’ve done including link to their work on the website, or for example, once the white paper is final, one of us will write a blog post to advertise it. Molly’s poster prize at PSI conference etc !\nChases people up who said they’d write a blog to ensure we are marketing our work in a timely manner.\nEnsures that when you receive content (blog/posts), that it’s sent to all the key contacts for organizations/Societies (See end of minutes for list)\n\nSocial media post list of upcoming posts\n1) Write a short message for Molly winning Poster prize. Just something in third person like “Congrats to Molly for winning a PSI Conference 2023 Poster Prize. If you want to see the poster it’s here.. (Molly to write, Lyn review, then send to Harshil/Christine to review - then Harshil to forward to contacts for advertising).\n2) Once White paper released, PHUSE will advertize but we should write something to share with our wider contacts\nWhite Paper Update No comments from Public review. Paper is here We checked for any last comments from the group. ACTION: Lyn to send confirmation that we are good to proceed to PHUSE tomorrow if no further comments.\nWebsite progress: Christina\nSubstantial content been added in the last month.\nOnce key area we’d like to progress on though is MMRM. ACTION: Christina to ask Kevin Kunzmann if he can write up something.\nLyn - To create a FAQ doc for the website. Make sure it references available material elsewhere so it doesn’t become out of date quickly.\nPSI AIMS will create github training which we can utilize to onboard statisticians.\nConference feedback:\nPSI Conference: Lyn/Christina/Martin/Molly/Aiming.

Nov virtual. POSIT CONF - September in chicago. (Lyn update website - Christina wont be at POSIT, split into 2 )\nPhuse EU connect : the CAMIS abstract was selected as back up talk only. However there are some companies who have company talks - which take priority so limited independent speakers to accept talks from. TBC if anyone on the list of speakers - could include a slide to advertise us at PHUSE EU!\nLessons learnt for conferences:\n1) Put PHUSE CAMIS on abstract (part of PHUSE DVOST).\n2) submit abstract for Poster & Talk - then you have the back up of a poster if talk is rejected.\nCAMIS- ONCO: Soma Sekhar\n\nNo update this month, carry to next month. Validation of endpoints (primary/secondary oncology endpoints). Propose to do poster at PHUSE CSS. Once Mia’s survival section is loaded. Sema Sekhar to review. Then highlight what’s missing - what else you want to add. Max combo. BICR vs RECIST? In future we can discuss how these fit with current CAMIS structure. Focus on the Stats method ideally.

However, follow the meeting, our slides were passed to others at the FDA and Vikrant Vijay got in touch to join the group. He’s not available today, but will attend in future.\nQuestionnaire only got 16 responses, 9/16 had heard of CAMIS, 13/16 used R for GXP, 4/15 used python for GXP, 1/16 used Julia for GXP. 9/16 had experienced discrepancies whilst trying to replicate analysis between languages.\nACTION: To re-run maybe just before CSS 2024 / or each year to assess progress and use for conference presentations.\nCommon programming challenges\n\nWhilst executing Analysis in R, I come across challenge in Numerical Differences in Statistical results. Would it be great if Industry & regulatory work together to build Standard R package for Statistical Methods & details in CAMIS repository would be highly appreciated.\nEnsuring reproducible environments and having people accept that different results for different implementations of an algorithm should perhaps be interpreted as a hint towards the accuracy, rather than one of the methods being wrong.\nStandard deviation initially did not match between and SAS. Later resolved by using the type option\nChallenges to figure out array of methods to replicate the same results across different software platforms/ Finding why resutls differ / unclear documentation/ discrepancy in values\nLS means contrasts from GLMs or MMRMs between SAS and R (vis lme4/mmrm + emmeans)\nParsing issues, scalability issues and network crash.\nImplementation of median seem to differ between R and SAS…. Sometimes joins in dplyr can also behave differently than i would expect with raw SQL\nDifferent methodologies (e.g for sample size calculation0 and lack of non-standard methods in SAS (e.g sample size for adaptive design).\n\nSocial Media update : Harshal\nNewsletter, (quarterly, or monthly) to advertise progress (ie. content we created) & conferences we are attending. Can we advertize ourself more to EMA, PMDA etc.. Can send to Frank Petavy (methodological working party). ACTION: Harshal/Lyn put togther summary for newsletter & send to Wilmar to reach out to Frank & others.

    "text": "Independant Two-Sample t-test in SAS\nThe null hypothesis of the Independent Samples t-test is, the means for the two populations are equal.\nIn SAS the following code was used to test the mean comparison (mean of Weight Gain) of two independent treatment groups (Treatment and Placebo).\nFor this example, we’re testing the significant difference in mean of Weight gain (WtGain) between treatment and placebo (trt_grp) using PROC TTEST procedure in SAS.\n\n  proc ttest data=d1; \n     class trt_grp; \n     var WtGain; \n  run; \n\nOutput:\n             Figure 1: Test results for independent t-test using PROC TTEST in SAS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the t-value is –0.70, degrees of freedom is 30 and P value is 0.4912 which is greater than 0.05, so we accept the null hypothesis that there is no evidence of a significant difference between the means of treatment groups. The mean in placebo group is 75.1875 and mean in Treatment group is 83.1250. The mean difference the treatment groups (Treatment-Placebo) is –7.9375 and the 95% CI for the mean difference is [–31.1984, 15.3234]. The 95% confidence interval includes a treatment difference of 0, which supports the conclusion that the data fail to provide any evidence of a difference between the treatment groups.\nNote: Before entering straight into the t-test we need to check whether the assumptions (like the equality of variance, the observations should be independent, observations should be normally distributed) are met or not. If normality is not satisfied, we may consider using a suitable non-parametric test.\n\nNormality: You can check for data to be normally distributed by plotting a histogram of the data by treatment. Alternatively, you can use the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the test is &lt;0.05 and your sample is quite small then this suggests you should not use the t-test. However, if your sample in each treatment group is large (say &gt;30 in each group), then you do not need to rely so heavily on the assumption that the data have an underlying normal distribution in order to apply the two-sample t-test. This is where plotting the data using histograms can help to support investigation into the normality assumption. We have checked the normality of the observations using the code below. Here for both the treatment groups we have P value greater than 0.05 (Shapiro-Wilk test is used), therefore the normality assumption is there for our data.\n\n\n    proc univariate data=d1 normal;  \n      qqplot WtGain; \n      by trt_grp; \n    run; \n\nOutput:\n        Figure 2: The results of normality test for Treatment group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Figure 3: The results of normality test for Placebo group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomogeneity of variance (or Equality of variance): Homogeniety of variance will be tested by default in PROC TTEST itself by Folded F-test. In our case the P values is 0.6981 which is greater than 0.05. So we accept the null hypothesis of F-test, i.e. variances are same. Then we will consider the pooled method for t-test. If the F test is statistically significant (p&lt;0.05), then the pooled t-test may give erroneous results. In this instance, if it is believed that the population variances may truly differ, then the Satterthwaite (unequal variances) analysis results should be used. These are provided in the SAS output alongside the Pooled results as default.\n\nOutput:\n                    Figure 4: Folded F-test result in PROC TTEST"

Below, the test is defined with the indicator variable (Species) by the CLASS statement, and the response variable (Sepal_Width) by the VAR statement. Adding the EXACT statement outputs the exact p-value in addition to the asymptotic result.

The table also includes a footnote to specify that ties were handled by using the average score.\nA table of the test results gives the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum statistic (10.922), the degrees of freedom (2), and the asymptotic p-value of the test (0.0042), and the exact p-value (0.0008). Therefore, the difference in population medians is statistically significant at the 5% level."

    "text": "Example 39.6 Multivariate Analysis of Variance from SAS MANOVA User Guide\nThis example employs multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to measure differences in the chemical characteristics of ancient pottery found at four kiln sites in Great Britain. The data are from Tubb, Parker, and Nickless (1980), as reported in Hand et al. (1994).\nFor each of 26 samples of pottery, the percentages of oxides of five metals are measured. The following statements create the data set and invoke the GLM procedure to perform a one-way MANOVA. Additionally, it is of interest to know whether the pottery from one site in Wales (Llanederyn) differs from the samples from other sites; a CONTRAST statement is used to test this hypothesis.\n\n    #Example code\n    title \"Romano-British Pottery\";\n   data pottery;\n      input Site $12.

These analyses show that sites are significantly different for all oxides individually. You can suppress these univariate analyses by specifying the NOUNI option in the MODEL statement.\n1 Summary Information about Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Univariate Analysis of Variance for Aluminum Oxide (AI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Univariate Analysis of Variance for Iron Oxide (Fe)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Univariate Analysis of Variance for Calcium Oxide (Ca)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Univariate Analysis of Variance for Magnesium Oxide (Mg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Analysis of Variance for Sodium Oxide (Na)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PRINTE option in the MANOVA statement displays the elements of the error matrix (7), also called the Error Sums of Squares and Crossproducts matrix. The diagonal elements of this matrix are the error sums of squares from the corresponding univariate analyses.\nThe PRINTE option also displays the partial correlation matrix (7) associated with the E matrix. In this example, none of the oxides are very strongly correlated; the strongest correlation (r=0.488) is between magnesium oxide and calcium oxide.\n7 Error SSCP Matrix and Partial Correlations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PRINTH option produces the SSCP matrix for the hypotheses being tested (Site and the contrast); (8 and 9). Since the Type III SS are the highest-level SS produced by PROC GLM by default, and since the HTYPE= option is not specified, the SSCP matrix for Site gives the Type III H matrix. The diagonal elements of this matrix are the model sums of squares from the corresponding univariate analyses.\nFour multivariate tests are computed, all based on the characteristic roots and vectors of \\(E^{-1}H\\). These roots and vectors are displayed along with the tests. All four tests can be transformed to variates that have distributions under the null hypothesis. Note that the four tests all give the same results for the contrast, since it has only one degree of freedom. In this case, the multivariate analysis matches the univariate results: there is an overall difference between the chemical composition of samples from different sites, and the samples from Llanederyn are different from the average of the other sites.\n8 Hypothesis SSCP Matrix and Multivariate Tests for Overall Site Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Hypothesis SSCP Matrix and Multivariate Tests for Differences between Llanederyn and the Other Sites\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nSAS MANOVA User Guide"

    "text": "Request for Contributions\nAlthough this project does have a core team, the endeavor of tracking all these comparisons will fail without community contributions. We welcome a wide variety of contributions from correcting small typos all the way to full write-ups comparing software (languages) for a method.\nPlease contribute by submitting a pull request and our team will review it. If you are adding a page please follow one of our templates:\n\nR template\n\nInstructions for Contributions to the CAMIS repository\nThe following instructions assume you have not done a contribution in the past. If you have contributed in the past skip down to step 5\n\nYou will need to get git, github, and RStudio setup to talk to each other. To do this you will need to have a github account and git installed on your computer. To connect your computer to github, we tend to recommend using a PAT because it is bit easier than SSH. We have a script that can help you set that up, found here. For more information Jenny Bryan has a great bookdown explaining how to get setup, alternatively see the following link for a short guidance.\nNow with RStudio all setup, you will need to “fork” the repository, which basically mean you want to make a copy of this repository that you own, so it will be under your github profile. This will allow you to make changes, without needing direct permission. To do this you will need to go into github, into the CAMIS repo, and click “fork”. This will give you some options of how you want to fork the repo, honestly you can just keep the defaults and then click “Create fork”\n\nOnce you’ve created a copy of this repository, you’ll need to clone it from GitHub to your computer. Click the “code” button to do this. The method you’ll use, either “HTTPS” or “SSH”, depends on how you’ve connected your computer to GitHub. If you’ve set up using a PAT, select the “HTTPS” tab. If you’ve used “SSH”, then choose that tab. Either way, you will need to copy the location in the box.\n\nIn RStudio, you will need to create a new project and select “Version Control” in the project wizard. Then you will select “Git” and finally paste the location copied from github into the URL box. Finally hit “Create Project” and you should be good to go!\n\nGo into RStudio and Create a branch – Give you are working from your own fork, this step it is a bit optional. It is up to you if you want to make a separate branch or not. But, it is generally considered good practice, especially if you are planning on contributing regularly. To do this from RStudio click the branch button (on the git tab top right). Within the box that comes up ensure you are on the “remote=origin” and “Sync branch with remote” is checked. You can name the branch something to do with the amends you intend to make.\nEdit and /or add files within the CAMIS directories. If you are adding SAS guidance store under sas folder, R guidance store under r folder, for “SAS vs R” comparison store under comp. Follow the naming convention of the files already stored in those folders.\nWithin R studio - Commit each change or new file added, and push to the repo from within R studio. Once you have completed the change you want to make, it is time for a pull request. Before we start though, it is good to check that your branch on github contains all the update you have done. If not you may need to push from Rstudio before moving onto the pull request.\n\nPull request in github - Back on your fork in github you will see that your repo is now ahead of the main CAMIS repository. The first thing you want to do is make sure there aren’t any conflict that have arisen with the main repository, so you need to click ‘Sync fork’.\n\nIf that is all good then you can create a pull request by clicking on ‘Contribute’ and then ‘Open pull request’. This brings you to a page where you can explain your pull request if you like or you can just confirm you would like to go through with this pull request. The final step is to add a reviewer, please add DrLynTaylor and statasaurus. For more details about making pull requests see create a pull request.\nOnce your change is approved, and merged into the origin, you will be able to see your changes on CAMIS. If you have made a branch in your fork the branch will be deleted and you will need to create a new branch to add further contributions. NOTE: you can make the new branch called the same as the old one if you wish but ensure you select to overwrite the previous one."
