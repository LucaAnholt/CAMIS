To demonstrate the various types of sums of squares, we'll create a data frame called \`df_disease\` taken from the SAS documentation (\_\_reference\_\_). The summary of the data is shown.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

library(readr)
library(skimr)
df_disease <- 
  read_csv(
    file = "../data/sas_disease.csv",
    col_types = cols(drug    = col_factor(),
                     disease = col_factor(),
                     y       = col_double()))

```

The general summary of the data is as follows

```{r}
summary(df_disease)

skim(df_disease)
```
